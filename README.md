                <p>Paige Simunovich, a wisp of a girl with almond-shaped green eyes, was scarcely out of diapers when she announced she wanted to be on Broadway. A couple of years later, she asked her mother, “When are you going to get that lady who gets me a job?”</p>
                <p> “She was asking me for an agent,” recalled Debbie Simunovich, Paige’s mother. “She was 5.”
                </p>

                <p>
                  Christopher Borger, who sings with a rhythm and blues vibe, used to belt Top 40 tunes in the shower, ignoring the hecklers outside his bathroom door. “Stop it, stop it,” Christopher remembered his parents shouting at him. “It sounds terrible.”
                </p>
                <p>
                  After a couple years of drama club and chorus competitions, Christopher auditioned for “The Lion King.”
                </p>
                <p>
                  “My husband kept saying, ‘What’s going on with this thing?’ ” said his mother, Melissa Borger. “I said: ‘Oh, don’t worry. He won’t get it.’ Then it gets down to 10 kids, then 4. Then it hits me: ‘I think he’s going to get it.’ Then, we’re leaving on tour.”
                </p>
                <p>
                  Now Paige, all of 12, and Christopher, 13, are doing eight shows a week on Broadway, having made their Broadway debuts Oct. 29 as Diana and Henry, the two children of Rainbow Valley in the whimsical “Finian’s Rainbow” at the St. James Theater.
                </p>            
                <p>
                  They are part of a swelling cast of child actors to hit Broadway stages, as producers try to lure more young people into theater seats in part by choosing shows with younger characters and casting ever-younger actors to portray them.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Paige’s and Christopher’s Playbill blurbs include the customary shout-outs to Mom and Dad, but hardly hint at the whirlwind and the sacrifice that paved their paths to Broadway.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Paige and Mrs. Simunovich moved from Old Tappan, N.J., to a one-bedroom apartment in Manhattan this year because the commute to auditions proved too taxing. Mrs. Borger left her job as a health care administrator in 2007 to tour with “The Lion King” across the East Coast and on to Taiwan, and then to home-school Christopher — and shuttle him from Long Island to auditions, rehearsals and performances (they also recently rented a tiny Union Square crash pad).
                </p>
                <p>
                  Christopher and Paige are not the stars of “Finian’s Rainbow,” yet they still worked 12-hour days leading up to the previews.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Free time? Dance, voice and acting lessons, and tutoring in the dressing room between calls, fill the gaps.

                <p>
                  Few children are built for Broadway, which requires adult-size doses of discipline, focus and resilience (never mind talent). These two long ago learned that casting depends as much on body type, skin color and personality as on singing and dancing abilities; Christopher’s contract stipulates that he can be let go if he grows two inches or gains more than 10 pounds.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Actors’ Equity Association ensures that children are paid on the same scale as adults — Paige and Christopher earn about $200 a performance, the bottom rung — though agents, managers and taxes eat up chunks, and 15 percent goes into a trust. On the other side of the balance sheet are private coaches with rates of $100-plus an hour, studio time, dancing shoes, audition clothes and those Manhattan apartments.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Leaving the theater one night at 10, Paige and her mom lugged a backpack, a tote and a rolling suitcase crammed with heavy textbooks onto two subways and a bus to get to their apartment. “No cabs for us,” Mrs. Simunovich explained. “It’s too expensive."
                </p>
                <p>
                  “Over the last year, if we’ve been home 10 days, that’s a lot,” she added. “Paige has to get some sleep. We’re giving up our home to come, stay here and do what we have to do.”
                </p>
                <p>
                  Have to? “It’s my life now,” Christopher said, sounding twice his age. “Broadway has taught me so many things. It sounds awkward from a kid saying this, but it’s true.”
                </p>
                <p>
                  Paige politely omitted the ‘Duh’ as she ticked off reasons she would never swap Broadway for, say, the junior high musical. “I’m getting to wake up each morning and not go to school, and hang out with the amazing cast,” she said. “I wouldn’t get to fulfill my dream if I didn’t do this. I can’t picture myself doing anything else.”
                </p>
                <p>
                  There are 53 actors under 16 working in New York’s major theaters this year, according to Actors’ Equity; last year there were 79, but there were no more than 30 in any of the five previous years. While these numbers vary with the season — “Billy Elliott” alone has 23 children in its cast — kids have become a mainstay of the Broadway curtain call, with more producers casting them in roles that used to go to youthful-looking adults.
                </p>
                <p>
                  “Just a few years ago, with ‘Hairspray,’ my friend was playing a high school kid at 36,” said Trapper Felides, a vocal coach. “Now it’s dropping down: High schoolers are playing high schoolers.”

                  (Children and teenagers are also a growing part of the audience: 12.4 percent in 2007-8, the latest season figure available from the Broadway League, and the largest share in 30 years.)
                </p>
                <p>
                  In turn, Broadway has become a more hospitable place for children to work. A 2003 state law brought the theaters more in line with Hollywood in terms of educational and financial protections. But while adult actors can relax between rehearsing scenes, children like Paige and Christopher must squeeze in history, math and English.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The “Finian’s” cast spent four weeks rehearsing in the Snapple Theater Center, off 50th Street. Between their scenes, the children were tutored in a space one floor up crammed with musical instruments, with occasional interruptions for fittings or hair consults.
                </p>
                <p>
                  On Sept. 28, the show moved into the St. James for 10 days of technical rehearsals that stretched from noon to midnight; a single scene could take four hours. Now that the show has opened, the schedule is lighter — school during the day, followed by dance or other lessons, then evening performances.
                </p>
                <p>
                  “It is survival of the fittest,” said Janine Molinari, their dance coach. “They have to have the stamina and drive. They have to have it.”
                </p>
                <p>
                  “Do I see Sharon in the tree?” Paige asked from the stage during an early October rehearsal. She was surrounded by most of the company, including the Tony-award winner Jim Norton, who plays Finian, an Irish immigrant, in this revival of a 1947 musical involving a leprechaun, a pot of gold and a white senator who turns black.
                </p>
                <p>
                  “No, it’s Broadway magic,” said Warren Carlyle, the show’s preternaturally pleasant director and choreographer.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In the wings, Aaron Bantum, 12, sat on a bench and stared at the stage, taking care as always to hear what Paige and Christopher hear. He is the understudy for both, and it is his first Broadway show, too. Aaron, who lives in Stamford, Conn., has done commercials and voice-overs, but has never taken an acting class.

                  “When I grow up, I don’t want to be extra famous,” he said. “I don’t want the paparazzi.” Bored during one long technical rehearsal, where his job was basically to do nothing, Aaron reached for a young woman’s iTouch to play the electronic Bubble Wrap game. “Hello, Miss Alissa,” chimed in Christopher, who is as polite as he is energetic.
                </p>
                <p>
                  “I tell him to please stop calling me that,” the young woman said with a trace of exasperation.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Paige plopped onto her lap. It is one of her favorite places to sit.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The woman is Alissa Zulvergold, 26, the “Finian’s” child wrangler — or “child strangler,” as one veteran actor interjected during cast and crew introductions on the first day in the theater.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Parents are not allowed backstage, so every Broadway production with actors under 16 must have a wrangler, usually a theater hand. Ms. Zulvergold reins in chaos and helps the youngsters make their cues, keep their costumes tidy, follow their stage directions. They shadow her and she shadows them. Part hall monitor, part confidante and part surrogate mother, Ms. Zulvergold, a stage manager who wrangled on “Beauty and the Beast” and “Dracula,” chastises the children for running, cuddles them when they are exhausted, referees their squabbles (usually about who ate what or went where) and whips out her iTouch when their self-control starts to dwindle.

                  “Christopher, go to the bathroom,” she said during a rehearsal break at the Snapple center one day.
                </p>
                <p>
                  “We have a love-hate relationship,” Christopher said with a smirk.
                </p>
                <p>
                  “Christopher, go to the bathroom,” Ms. Zulvergold deadpanned.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Another day, she tossed this reminder his way: “Can you zip your fly up before you get out on the Broadway stage?”
                </p>
                <p>
                  The three children spend so much time together they behave like siblings, with all the tenderness and annoyance that engenders. Before Christopher ran onstage one day, he gave Aaron an unexpected hug. But when Paige complained that Christopher was taking too long to put on his jeans after an evening performance — delaying their departure — Christopher erupted.
                </p>
                <p>
                  “Oh, my God,” he said. “Once, you’ve waited for me. You know how many times I’ve waited for you?”
                </p>
                <p>
                  For kids, working on Broadway can be the ultimate acting school. Paige and Christopher chat unselfconsciously with adult cast members, regardless of star power or pecking order. They see how the Tony-nominated actor Christopher Fitzgerald, who plays the leprechaun Og, changes his inflection as he sings a song that teeters raucously between love and lust, and watch Kate Baldwin and Cheyenne Jackson unspool their courtship on stage, appearing to mean it.
                </p>
                <p>
                  “They are not jaded yet, and I try to remember that feeling,” said Mr. Jackson, who also starred in “Xanadu.” “It’s called a play, not a work.”
                </p>
                <p>
                  At the St. James, until recently, the children’s dressing room doubled as a classroom — a kid’s dream classroom, where they could stretch out on the floor, snack while they studied and ask questions as they came. The “Finian’s” producers paid for a tutor who shuffled among the three youngsters as they worked on their individual curriculums for at least three hours a day.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Lessons unfold in fits and starts depending on rehearsals, and sometimes with the shouts of Og pouring in from the stage via intercom. One day, barefoot on the floor typing into her laptop, Paige announced to no one in particular, “God, my feet grew overnight.” Her feet are a pet peeve.

                  Aaron, disgusted with social studies, laid his head on a table. The kids had gone to bed close to midnight the night before. “Sit up, sit up,” the tutor urged. “You put your head down and you fall asleep. O.K., stand up. Let’s stretch.”
                </p>
                <p>
                  Then the boys got called for a fitting and raced the seven flights downstairs. Paige stayed, eating sushi and worrying about the quiz.

                  Paige is a perfectionist and a self-starter. She never forgets to do her homework or pack the right hair ties. Motion is her natural state. As she talks, she points her feet, fluffs a pillow, executes a quick tap step. Bored one Sunday afternoon, she went on YouTube to learn how to make origami flowers out of magazines.
                </p>
                <p>
                  “She’s so efficient she can’t help herself,” Mrs. Simunovich said.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Last year, Paige left her Catholic school in Old Tappan, where absences were piling up because of her acting, and enrolled at the Professional Children’s School near Columbus Circle, which tailors academic programs to students’ careers. As she stepped up auditions, she and her mother moved into a one-bedroom on York Avenue, where Paige sleeps on a couch near her dog, Smokey (who also gets a shout out in Playbill). For a while, Paige and Mrs. Simunovich went home on Sundays to see Paige’s father, a contractor who owns an Italian restaurant, and her two sisters; now there is a 3 p.m. show.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Mrs. Simunovich spends time talking and texting on the phone with her other daughters: Chelsea, a 12th grader, and Rachel, an eighth grader who feels the sting of her mother’s absence more keenly. Mom tries to carve out special time for shopping or other outings with Rachel, but Paige simply requires more.
                </p>
                <p>
                  “Paige couldn’t get to where she wants to go if we were not supporting her,” Mrs. Simunovich said.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Mrs. Borger still mourns missing much of the year that her daughter, Alexi, spent in kindergarten while Christopher toured in “The Lion King.”
                </p>

              <div class="col s8 offset-s2">

                <p>
                  During rehearsals for “Finian’s,” the Borgers drove an hour home to Wantagh, N.Y., most nights to have a little family time with Christopher’s father, Joseph, a general contractor, and sister, Alexi, now 7. Mrs. Borger makes a point of fussing over Alexi in the morning, cooking special breakfasts, blowing dry her hair and walking her to the bus. But then she is off with Christopher for another endless day, sometimes crashing in the minuscule sixth-floor walkup off Union Square where she and her son share a futon.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Working mothers are rare in the business. “I gave up my career and the benefits,” Mrs. Borger noted. “Now my husband has to make up for that.”
                </p>
                <p>
                  The day of the first performance in front of an audience — family and friends only — Paige worried about hopping across the stage on her pogo stick. “I’m so scared, I can’t move,” she told Ms. Zulvergold, the wrangler.

                  “You’ll be fine,” Ms. Zulvergold assured her. “If you fall off, you walk with it across the stage.”

                  The pogo went smoothly. Christopher cut his hand when the fake flowers he had to pluck. Ms. Zulvergold brought out the Band-Aids and Neosporin.

                  As the curtain dropped and then rose again, Christopher and Paige beamed. They took their bows, then ran upstairs to change clothes quickly.

                  “O.K.,” said Paige, now a veteran. “I’ve got to get home. I’m so tired.”
